                            <p>When it comes to setting big goals, people focus on changing their actions to make progress. But that's second order.</p>
                            <p>First order: <strong>Changing who you are so that your behavior naturally follows.</strong></p>
                            <p>The bodybuilder doesn't "grind" to eat healthy. They can't see themselves living any other way. The CEO doesn't discipline themselves to show up. They would hate lying in bed past their alarm.</p>

                            <p>All behavior is goal-oriented. It's teleological. But most of your goals are unconscious.</p>
                            <p>If you can't stop procrastinating, you're not lacking discipline. You're achieving the goal of <strong>protecting yourself from judgment</strong> that comes from finishing and sharing your work.</p>
                            <p>If you stay in a dead-end job, you're not lacking courage. You're pursuing the goal of safety, predictability, and avoiding the appearance of failure.</p>
                            <p class="highlight">Real change requires changing your goals. Not setting new ones, but changing your point of view.</p>
                            <p>A goal is a projection into the future that acts as a lens of perception, allowing you to notice information, ideas, and resources that aid in achieving it.</p>

                            <p>This process started when you were a child. You were conditioned through reward and punishment to adopt beliefs and values that kept you safe.</p>
