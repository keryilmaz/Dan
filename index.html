                <p>When it comes to setting big goals, people focus on changing their <em>actions</em> to make progress. But that's second order.</p>
                
                <p>First order: <strong>Changing who you are so that your behavior naturally follows.</strong></p>
                
                <p>Think of somebody successful. A bodybuilder with a great physique. A founder worth hundreds of millions. Do you think the bodybuilder has to "grind" to eat healthy? Does the CEO discipline themselves to show up?</p>
                
                <p>The truth is they can't see themselves living any other way. The bodybuilder has to grind to eat <em>unhealthily</em>. The CEO has to force themselves to lie in bed past their alarm, and they hate every second of it.</p>

                <p>When you truly change yourself, all of your habits that don't move the needle become disgusting, because you have a deep awareness of what kind of life those actions compound into.</p>

                <p>All behavior is goal-oriented. It's teleological. When you think about it, this is obvious—but most of the time, your goals are unconscious.</p>
                
                <p>If you can't stop procrastinating, you may justify it with "I lack discipline." But in reality, you are achieving a goal: <strong>protecting yourself from the judgment that comes from finishing and sharing your work.</strong></p>
                
                <p>If you stay in a dead-end job, you may think you lack courage. But you're pursuing the goal of safety, predictability, and an excuse to not look like a failure.</p>

                    <li>You notice "important" information that helps you achieve it (learning)</li>

                    <li>You repeat until it becomes automatic (conditioning)</li>

                    <li>Your identity shapes new goals, restarting the cycle</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>This process started when you were a child. You conformed to survive. Through reward and punishment, you adopted beliefs and values to stay safe.</p>

                <p>If you are heavily identified with an ideology, you will feel threatened when someone challenges your beliefs. You literally feel the stress—like you were slapped in the face.</p>
                
                <p>The same happens when you unconsciously see yourself as someone who would not take the actions to achieve a better life.</p>
